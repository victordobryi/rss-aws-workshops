In Lab 2, we first create an custom AMI using the EC2 instance built in Lab 1, then create an application load balancer, attach the  [Auto Scaling Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/AutoScalingGroup.html) which launches EC2 instances in private subnet. Finally, we create an [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront) distribution as CDN and change the configuration of WordPress.
